      <h3>The Golden Legend</h3>
      <p>
      The Golden Gate is a strait on the west coast of North America that connects San Francisco Bay
      to the Pacific Ocean. It is defined by the headlands of the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Peninsula,
      and, since 1937, has been spanned by the Golden Gate Bridge. The entire shoreline and adjacent waters
      throughout the strait are managed by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
      The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the opening of the San Francisco Bay
      onto the Pacific Ocean. As part of both US Highway 101 and California Route 1, it connects the city of San Francisco
      on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County.
      The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when completed in 1937, and is an
      internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco and California in general. Since its completion, the span length
      has been surpassed by eight other bridges. It still has the second longest suspension bridge main span in the
      United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. In 2007, it was ranked fifth on the List
      of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects. Find more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate">Wikipedia</a>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
      Before the Europeans arrived in the 18th century, the area around the strait and the bay was inhabited by the Ohlone
      to the south and Coast Miwok people to the north. Descendants of both tribes remain in the area.The strait was surprisingly
      elusive for early European explorers, presumably due to persistent summer fog. The strait is not recorded in the voyages
      of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo nor Francis Drake, both of whom may have explored the nearby coast in the 16th century in search of
      the fabled Northwest Passage. The strait is also unrecorded in observations by Spanish galleons returning from the Philippines that
      laid up in nearby Drakes Bay to the north. These galleons rarely passed east of the Farallon Islands, for fear of the possibility of
      rocks between the islands and the mainland. The first recorded observation of the strait occurred nearly two hundred years later than
      the earliest European explorations of the coast. In 1769, Sgt José Francisco Ortega, the leader of a scouting party sent north along the
      San Francisco Peninsula by Don Gaspar de Portolá from their expedition encampment in San Pedro Valley to locate the Point Reyes headlands,
      reported back to Portolá that he could not reach the location because of his encounter with the strait.
